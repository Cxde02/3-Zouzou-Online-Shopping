</div>
<div class="sub1text">
    3Zouzou has a persistent dedication to success and a track record of accomplishments that upholds a tradition of
    providing excellence.<BR>
    The 3 idiots group established the business in 2023 to make the procedure of ordering different toys simpler for
    parents. With its humble beginnings with only three employees, 3Zouzou's ambitions are to be a well-known
    e-commerce store throughout the world with more than 10000 workers.<BR>
    Five guiding principles serve as the foundation of 3Zouzou: obsessing on the customer rather than the competition,
    being inventive, being dedicated to operational excellence, having the latest products for our clients, and having a
    long-term perspective.
